# alm_replication

This is a replication exercise of a past policy report submitted as part of my Applied Linear Modeling graduate coursework at the University of Pennsylvania. All original code for the analysis was written in R. The code in this notebook focuses on model corrections and is written in Python, specifically leveraging the statsmodels package. For more details on the underlying diagnostics used for model correction and the original R code, please refer to the [eventual writeup](https://github.com/anuraghuram/alm_replication/blob/master/Applied%20linear%20modeling%20exercise%20.pdf) in this repo.
